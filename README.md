# Overview
Using the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, an interactive dashboard was created to explore the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. This dashboard has five elements, the first is the Test Subject ID No. dropdown which displays each test subject ID and changes the remaining charts based on selection, allowing users to explore the data at the click of a button. The remaining elements are four graphs, a demographic chart that details general characteristics such as gender, age, etc., a bar graph showing the top 10 OTUs per test subject, a bubble chart denoting the relative amount of OTUs present per individual, and finally a gauge displaying the washing frequency per week for each subject.
